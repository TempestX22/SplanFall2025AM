					<h3>What is it?</h3>
					<p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system. It is a big ball of gas and plasma that
						generates its
						own energy through nuclear fusion in its core. As our one and only star, it is the only natural
						source of
						light in the entire solar system. </p>

					<h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
					<p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system. It has a mass of around 330,000
						times that of Earth.
						It is three-quarters hydrogen and most of its remaining mass is helium.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
					<p>The Sun is halfway through its life. At 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has burned off around half
						of its hydrogen
						stores and has enough left to continue burning hydrogen for another 5 billion years. Currently,
						the Sun is a yellow dwarf star.</p>
