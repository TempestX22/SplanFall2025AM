<h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <p>
    The shiitake (Japanese: 椎茸), scientific name <i>Lentinula edodes</i>, is a macrofungus native to East Asia, <br>
    widely cultivated and consumed around the world. It grows on decaying hardwood logs (especially oak, chestnut, etc.) <br>
    and is prized for its rich flavor and aroma. The species was first described as <i>Agaricus edodes</i> by Miles <br>
    Joseph Berkeley in 1877, and later reassigned to the genus <i>Lentinula</i> by David Pegler in 1976.  <br>
  </p>

  <h3>TAXONOMY</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Genus:</strong> Lentinula  <br>
    <strong>Species:</strong> edodes  <br>
    <strong>Authority:</strong> (Berk.) Pegler (1976)  <br>
    <strong>Synonyms / earlier names:</strong>  
    Agaricus edodes, Armillaria edodes, Lentinus edodes, and more.   
  </p>

  <h3>MORPHOLOGY & ECOLOGY</h3>
  <p>
    The cap size ranges roughly from 5 to 25 cm across; when young it is darker <br>
    and then tends toward brown as it matures. The gills are free, the stipe <br>
    is bare and fibrous, and the spore print is white. Ecologically, shiitake <br>
    is saprotrophic, decomposing dead hardwoods (e.g. oak), breaking down cellulose and lignin. <br>  
  </p>

  <h3>USES & SIGNIFICANCE</h3>
  <p>
    Shiitake is one of the most commonly cultivated edible mushrooms globally.   <br>
    It is valued in cuisine for its umami flavor, and in traditional medicine <br>
    and research for bioactive compounds such as lentinan (a β-glucan) which <br>
    is studied for potential immunomodulatory effects.  <br>
    In some countries, lentinan is used as an adjunctive therapy in cancer treatment.  <br>
